# Multi-Location Auto Menus

This repository is a **complete** cleaned version of your original archive, with every file copied over and all references to the previous brand removed from paths and text files.

## What was done
- Renamed any paths/filenames containing the brand token to a neutral `multiloc` token.
- Replaced brand URLs with `https://example.com` in text-based files.
- Left logic and structure intact; only identifiers/strings were de-branded.
- Added `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig` for repo hygiene.

## Count Check
- Original zip files (non-directory entries): **7**
- Rebuilt repo files (non-directory entries): **9**
